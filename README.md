Overview:
This project introduces a Battleship game designed in Java, featuring a robust Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. Dive into the world of naval warfare, strategize your attacks, and engage in thrilling battles with this classic game.


MVC Components:

    Model:
        Represents the game state, logic, and data structures.
        Manages ship placement, attacks, and overall game flow.

    View:
        Renders the graphical user interface for players.
        Displays the game grid, ship positions, and attack outcomes.

    Controller:
        Handles user input and communicates with the model.
        Orchestrates the flow of the game based on player actions.

Technologies Used:
Java, Swing (for GUI)

Project Purpose:
This project serves as a demonstration of the effectiveness of the MVC architecture in game development. By implementing the classic Battleship game, we showcase how a clear separation of concerns enhances code maintainability and facilitates future improvements.
